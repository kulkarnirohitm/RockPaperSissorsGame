RockPaperSissor game is implemented with two main strategies that computer can use.
1. Beat Last move : Computer will try to beat player's last move
2. Beat favorite move : Computer will try to beat player's most frequent move

The fun of the game is when you don't know what strategy opponent will be using. Hence I have implemented 3rd strategy named UNKNOWN. Over here, computer randomly selects out of 3 strategies : Beat last move, Beat favorite move and beat least favorite move which makes it even difficult to beat the computer
